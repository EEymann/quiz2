#### _This program is a quiz app built with objects stored in an array. It is an improvement on my quiz1 app. September 2020_

## Description

_This project comes from teamtreehouse.com. This app is an improvement on my quiz1 app. The difference between quiz1 and quiz2 is this: in quiz2, instead of a multidimensional array, I store objects within one array named 'questions'. Within each object I have two key/value pairs named 'question' and 'answer'. To retrieve these question/answer properties in the for loop, I tap into each question/answer using the question/answer property of question. The rest is the same as quiz1: first I store the number of questions answered correctly in a variable. Second, I use a loop to cycle through each question, then:
    - Present each question to the user
    - Compare the user's response to answer in the array
    - If the response matches the answer, the number of correctly
      answered questions increments by 1.
Fourth, I push the question(s) of the correct answer(s) to an array named 'correct', and the question(s) of the incorrect answer(s) to an array called 'incorrect'. Finally, using a function, I display the number of correct answers to the user, including which questions the user got correct, and which ones the user got wrong._
